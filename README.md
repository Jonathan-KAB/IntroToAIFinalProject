**Features**

* Chatbot integration to allow children to feel like less alienated from the model
* Synthetic word suggestion based on individual Twi words provided

**Usage**

In keeping with the United Nation's SDG Goal 4, our project is focused on fine tuning a natural language processor (NLP for short) to suggest better Twi words for learners within the age groups of 5-12 based on the Twi sentences they feed the model.

**Downloading and Opening the Repository**

A Google Drive link has been provided to access additional documents required to locally host the model and GUI:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-DbUBMhlf6VDdwzd59qm9HU1jfI7OFus?usp=drive_link

**Running the Application**

Due to Github's size limitation, the app's model (a folder aptly titled "fine-tuned-model") and the GUI (twi_test_gui.py) will need to be downloaded from the Google Drive link provided.

* After downloading both folder and Python file, place them in a folder and name it "FINAL" or a name of your choosing (Likewise, you can download the Drive folder in its entirety)
* Kindly open **Command Prompt as adminstrator** or **Terminal** depending on your operation system
* Type "cd" (without the quotation marks) followed by the directory for the main folder, and hit Enter
* Afterwards, type "streamlit run twi_test_gui.py" without the quotation marks, and hit Enter
* If the instructions are followed correctly, a browser window should appear and run the "Kasa Twi Nu!" program
